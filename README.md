#### Brief Description of Project - This project is based on a Hotel Management System that is to be developed for the Amalya Reach Hotel Moragahahena, Homagama. We selected our client from this hotel. When talking of the Amalya Reach Hotel, it is mainly a tourist-based hotel and it provides facilities to both local and foreign tourists. That is why many tourists enjoy their leisure time well with this.
